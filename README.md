# AI Virtual Mouse with Hand Gesture Control

This project proposes a novel method for controlling the mouse cursor using fingertip movements captured by a webcam, eliminating the need for physical devices. Built with Python, OpenCV, Autopy, Mediapipe, and NumPy, it offers accurate gesture recognition and interaction with the computer.

## Features
- Control mouse cursor with fingertip movements
- Perform operations like clicking and dragging with hand gestures
- Requires only a webcam as an input device
- High accuracy and gesture elimination
- Works well in low light and changing light conditions
- Tracks fingertips of different shapes and sizes accurately
- Potential for adding new gestures and interacting with smart systems
- Possible integration with machine learning algorithms like OpenPose

## Dependencies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Autopy
- Mediapipe
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow on-screen instructions for calibration and usage.

## Future Enhancements
- Addition of new gestures for easier system handling
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for enhanced tracking
- Inclusion of body, hand, and facial keypoints for diverse gestures
